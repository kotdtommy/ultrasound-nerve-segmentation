# Ultrasound-nerve-segmentation using a U-Net model

This jupyter notebook was implemented using PyTorch and the dataset was obtained using Kaggle cli. Platform used: <a href="https://www.floydhub.com/">Floydhub</a>. You can get more info about U-Nets here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597.

Much of the preprocessing and basic model building was inspired by <a href= "https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation">Jocic Marko's excellent starter code</a>. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation#evaluation">Dice Loss</a> used.

Implementation using Generative Adversarial Networks is on the way. Stay Tuned!
